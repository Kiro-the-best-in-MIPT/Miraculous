-Ar: I'm tired from fastfood, i need a meal.
-A: The energy in this world doesn't same like an Equestria. We can only gain so much power here..
-Ar: Oh, i wish we'd never been banished in this awful place...
-A: Really?...I love it here! (ironic)
-S: For real this? Because I think that place is the worst..
-Ar: I think you are the worst, Sonata...

-A: It's Equestrian magic!
-Ar: But this world doesn't have Equestrian magic...
